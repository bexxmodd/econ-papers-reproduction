# Reproduction of Economic papers using python 3.0
I decided to start a series of reproducing economics papers using Python.
I will try to get the same results, using their data, that are shown in the paper, however, I will concentrate on how they came to the conclusion of choosing that particular model and explaining all the minor findings.
The purpose of this repository is to post reproductions of the results of famous economic papers using python. In lieu of general codes, I'll concentrate on analyzing findings.
